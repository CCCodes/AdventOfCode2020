# Advent of Code 2020

My solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020) challenges in Python 3.
The challenge descriptions can be found on the linked page, and my solutions to each challenge can be found in the corresponding .py file.
The challenges are listed in order of generally increasing difficulty (day 1 through 25).

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.
